Web Development Final Project - Mini Game Arcade

This is a web-based collection of 3 games: rock, paper, scissors, number guessing, and a click challenge. Users can play these games and create a profile to save their highscores. Web pages use DOM manipulation, local storage, responsive web design, and game logic. HTML, CSS, and JS are implemented with object handling and form validation.
